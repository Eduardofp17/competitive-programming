# Repository Overview

This repository contains solutions to various problems, each submitted on their respective platforms before being consolidated here.

### File Naming Convention
The filenames adhere to the following format: `[problem-id]?-[problem-name].[extension]`. The use of the ternary operator (`?`) signifies that the information should be considered only if it exists.

**Note:** In cases where problem names are lengthy, only the problem ID may be provided for brevity.

**Note:** The problem remains in the directory where it was originally submitted. For instance, if you've solved a Codeforces problem that also exists on Beecrowd, the respective solution will be located in the directory corresponding to its initial submission platform.

**Note:** When dealing with obi problems, we'll utilize the following format: `[problem's year]-[problem-name].[extension]`.

**Note:** When dealing with usaco problems, we'll utilize the following format: `[problem's year]-[problem-name].[extension]`.

## Supported Languages
As of now, the repository primarily contains solutions implemented in `C++`. However, additional solutions in various languages such as `Java`, `Python`, `Golang`, `JavaScript`, or `TypeScript` will be introduced soon. Stay tuned for a more diverse language repertoire.

## Commit Message Format

The commit messages will follow this format:

- **(add):PATH:** when adding a new solution.
- **(fix):PATH:** for fixing issues.
- **(impro):PATH:** when improving aspects such as time complexity or other enhancements.
